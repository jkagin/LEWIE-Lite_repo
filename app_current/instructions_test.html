<h1>WELCOME to the LEWIE-Lite DASHBOARD</h1>

<p>On this dashboard, you can run simple simulations to calculate multipliers of a tourism project using a LEWIE-Lite
  model.</p>

<p>A LEWIE-Lite model is a multiplier model based on a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of the target area.</p>

<h2><a href="#" onclick="toggle('what')">What does the Dashboard display?</a></h2>
<div id="what" style="display:none">
  <h3>The TOP Panel</h3>
  <p>It shows multipliers of tourism activities in the project area. They represent dollar increases <strong>per dollar
      of tourist spending</strong>.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Total production multiplier</strong> is the overall increase value generated in the economy (any goods
    or services) for each dollar spent by a tourist.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Total income multiplier</strong> is the dollar increase in household incomes for each dollar of tourist
    spending. We also break down this income multiplier in two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The total income multiplier can be broken down into:
      <ul>
        <li>Accruing to Poor households: Dollar increase in Poor household incomes for each dollar of tourist spending.
        </li>
        <li>Accruing to NonPoor households: Dollar increase in NonPoor household incomes for each dollar of tourist
          spending.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The same total income multiplier can also be broken down into:
      <ul>
        <li>Accruing to Labor: Dollar increase in household incomes from use of their Labor (for each dollar of tourist
          spending)</li>
        <li>Accruing to Labor: Dollar increase in household incomes from as a return to Capital (for each dollar of
          tourist spending)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The BOTTOM Panel</h3>
  <p>It shows plots of value ($) generated by tourism spending. These are based on the multipliers, but can be scaled by
    changing tourist spending.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The BOX "<strong>How much tourist spending ($) do you expect?</strong>" is set to $100 by default. It can be
      changed to any positive value, and the expected earnings will be shown in the plots.
      (Note that this does not change the multipliers, which are all per-dollar values).</li>

    <li>The three plots show the returns on <strong>Production</strong> (split by activity), <strong>Household
        Incomes</strong> (split by household type) and <strong>Labor Income</strong> (split by gender and skill), which
      would be generated by whatever expected tourist spending value is in the Box.</li>
  </ul>

<h2><a href="#" onclick="toggle('how')">How to use the Dashboard?</a></h2>
<div id="how" style="display:none">
  <p>The first way to use the dashboard is simply to read and report the multipliers in the top panel.</p>
  <p>The second way to use it is to input any value you want under "<strong>How much tourist spending ($) do you
      expect?</strong>" to generate expected values of </p>
</div>

<h2><a href="#" onclick="toggle('sam')">Can I see the SAM?</a></h2>
<div id="sam" style="display:none">
  <p>All multipliers are based on the SAM displayed in the <strong>DATA</strong> panel, in the "SAM_RASed" tab.</p>

  <p>The <strong>DATA</strong> tab also shows all the data that went into constructing the SAM (see below)</p>
